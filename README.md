Currency Converter Application Test
Objective:
Create a NextJs application that allows users to calculate conversion between currencies. 
The purpose of this test is to test your ability to solve problems and how you approach writing code.

User Interface:
Having a fancy design is not compulsory and may not affect how we judge your performance.  


Currency Data:
You will find a `data.json` file included in this repository where you can access dummy data for your user interface.
# Tip: Implement an API endpoint with this data using Next.js API Routes.


Conversion Logic:
Use the conversion calculator on [here](https://www.wewire.com/rates) as your guide, 
the only twist here is that you should enable users enter the amount they want to receive 
and calculate the amount they would have to give.



TypeScript Implementation:
Use strong typing throughout the application. Create interfaces for API responses and component props.


Responsive Design:
Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.


Performance Optimization:
Implement memoization techniques to optimize component rendering. Use debouncing for API calls to reduce unnecessary requests.


Code Quality:
Follow best practices for React and TypeScript. Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Provide clear comments and documentation where necessary.


Submission:
Provide a GitHub repository with your code. Include a README.md with instructions on how to run the application locally.Deploy the application to a free hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify) and provide the live URL.

Evaluation Criteria:
Code organization and cleanliness
Proper use of React hooks and TypeScript features
UI/UX design and responsiveness
Implementation of required features
Performance and optimization techniques
Error handling and edge case management

Time Limit:
You have 4 days to complete this test. Quality is more important than speed, so take the time to showcase your best work.
Would you like me to elaborate on any part of these instructions?
